# Micropython libraries to help with IDEs autocompletion.

# Install in editable mode:
```
pip install -e .
```

# Install from github:
```
pip install project_name@git+"https://github.com/GBiondo1310/micropython_libraries.git#egg=<project_name>"
```
### Note:
It's advised to create a separate venv to install this package in, in order not to create conflicts with the python standard library. Then activate that separate env when you need the autocompletion
